How does it work?
Train a recurrent neural network (RNN) decoder on romance novels.
Each passage from a novel is mapped to a skip-thought vector.
Conditions RNN on skip-thought vector & generate the encoded passage.
Train a visual-semantic embedding between COCO images and captions. Captions and images are mapped into a common vector space.
After training, embed new images and retrieve captions.

Queries
Find a genre and make the model based on that?
